      To Whom It May Concern:
      <br />
      I am writing to apply as an Engineer in Experimental Storytelling at The Atlantic. This is my Experimental Cover Letter.
      We’ll begin with a boring example.
      <br />
      I have been studying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as a storyteller. You’ll find one of my recent projects, Exquisite
      Corpse, was built around this concept. It’s an app where users can log-in and partake in playing a creative writing
      game: based on the 1920s tradition of blind collaboration, users are given a prompt and can start a story from scratch
      or start writing on another’s story but can’t see anything but their own contribution until the entire story is
      published. Designing this product was super exciting because our team had to explore technologies new to us (API design,
      Express.js, knex, and PostgresQL).
